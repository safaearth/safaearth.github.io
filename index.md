## Project Experience

- **[Real-time face recognition system based on OpenCV](https://blog.csdn.net/Insincerity/article/details/105838856)**

  This project built a video image attendance system in the Windows 10 environment, using Visual Studio 2017, Anaconda3.5.3, OpenCV-4.1.0 and OpenCV-contrib-4.1.0 to build, complete the collection of face images,Collect images to gray scale, make CSV directory file, generate XML training set, face matching, and finally achieve the purpose of real-time attendance of video images.To realize a complete video image attendance, there are four parts in total: collecting face pictures, making CSV files, making XML training set files, and making face recognition and matching attendance.When making the CSV directory file, use the Python script in Anaconda to generate the CSV file.In the face image collection, the production of XML training set, the final face matching attendance part is completed by Visual Studio 2017.This project introduces the basic theory of face recognition, the principle and model of face recognition, explains the code part, and records the whole process of the project design and implementation.
